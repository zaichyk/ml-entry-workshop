# ML Entry Workshop: Building Your Own Tinder Model ðŸš€

Welcome to the Machine Learning Entry Workshop! This workshop is designed to introduce beginners to the fundamentals of machine learning through a fun, practical project: building a model that learns your personal photo preferences, similar to a dating app.

## Workshop Overview

In this hands-on workshop, you will:

1. Learn core machine learning concepts (supervised learning)
2. Understand how neural networks work and visualize their components
3. Create your own dataset by rating photos
4. Prepare data for model training
5. Train a CNN model to predict your preferences
6. Evaluate model performance with interactive tools

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of Python
- Curiosity about machine learning

### Setup Instructions

1. Install uv (package manager):
   ```
   brew install uv
   ```

2. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone git@github.com:zaichyk/ml-entry-workshop.git
   ```

3. Navigate to the repo and install dependencies:
   ```
   cd ml-entry-workshop
   uv sync
   ```

4. Activate your venv and create a new ipykernel
   ```
   source .venv/bin/activate (you are now in your uv venv)
   python -m ipykernel install --user --name=mlworkshop --display-name "Python (ML Workshop)"
   ```
   
5. Important: If you plan to work with the men's dataset, you'll need to remove images 21, 37, and 243 as they may cause errors during processing.

6. Open the workshop notebooks:
   ```
   cd ml_entry_workshop
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   Then open either `workshop_notebook.ipynb` or `What is Neural Network.ipynb`

## Workshop Structure
